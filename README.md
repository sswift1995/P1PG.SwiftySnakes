 This is my Browser Game Project 1.
 
 # MyInspiration
This game was inspired from my past as a little girl when I used to play the snakes game on my parents small Nokia phone. It was so entertaining 
and I'va alaways been a fan favorite of the classics. I have always been inspired to  adapt and cultivate other games or codes as well. 

# How to play:

Simple basic functions you will build up your snake by feeding him without touching any part of your snake character or the four walls surrounding the snake. To start pressing any arrow keys to move your snake and see how much your snake can grow! Arrows: Up , Down , Left , Right.


# Functioning/Errors:

I came across alittle snag with my code; when you click the restart button it will restart the coordinates of the food and snake. The snake will start moving by itself and run into the wall. The more you click the restart button the faster the snake will get.  I used the changeDirection = null; to have the moving function not start. The code won't take and it is still doing the movement. The game functions perfectly fine other than the restarting function.
